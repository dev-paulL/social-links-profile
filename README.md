## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I don't have access to the Frontend Mentor Pro version, which includes Figma files for some projects. Instead, I practice my attention to detail by closely replicating the original designs based on screenshots rather than mockups.
